🔗 Why Blockchains?
Inflating Currencies: Central banks can print unlimited money, reducing its value over time.

Inflation Effects: Distributing printed money equally causes purchasing power to drop.

Bailouts: Governments rescuing failing institutions can lead to economic unfairness.

Need for a Better Currency: A new form of money should be transparent, decentralized, and immune to manipulation.

Fractional Reserve Banking: Banks hold only a small fraction of deposits, risking collapse during mass withdrawals.

Currency Depreciation: Traditional fiat money gradually loses value.

No Asset Backing: Modern currencies are no longer backed by physical assets like gold.

Watch Recommendation: The Big Short (film) — A great intro to financial collapse and its causes.

🧱 What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant way — without needing a central authority.

🌟 Key Characteristics of Blockchain
Decentralization: Multiple nodes share control — no central power.

Immutability: Once added, data can’t be modified or deleted.

Transparency: Everyone can verify and view transactions.

Consensus Mechanisms: Used to validate transactions (e.g., PoW, PoS).

🎯 Purpose of Blockchain
Everyone can participate — no gatekeepers.

No single party has control.

Enables secure, open, tamper-proof systems.

💰 Creating a New Currency with Blockchain
✅ Why?
Trustless: No need to trust a central authority.

Transparent: Transactions are public and verifiable.

Decentralized: Power is distributed across the network.

Anonymous: Identities are hidden but actions are visible.

🧮 Hashing in Blockchain
What is Hashing?
It’s the process of converting input data into a fixed-length string (hash) using a hash function.

Properties of a Good Hash Function:
Deterministic: Same input → same output.

Fast: Quick computation.

Pre-image Resistance: Can't reverse-engineer input.

Avalanche Effect: Small input changes → drastically different output.

Collision Resistant: Rarely produces the same hash for two inputs.

🔐 SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm - 256 bit)
Produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash.

Widely used in blockchain (like Bitcoin).

Example use: verifying data integrity.

🔒 Hashing vs Encryption
Feature	Hashing	Encryption
Direction	One-way	Two-way (reversible with key)
Use Case	Data integrity	Confidentiality
Example Use	Passwords, blockchain hashes	Messages, secure storage

🧱 How Blockchain Works
🔹 Blocks
Each block contains:

Transactions

Timestamp

Hash of the previous block

🔗 Chain
Blocks are linked in sequence:

Forms a chain (hence the name)

Prevents tampering

📘 Important Concepts
Nonce
A random number used once

Found by miners to create a valid block hash

Key to solving the Proof of Work challenge

Miners
Compete to find the correct nonce

More compute power = higher chance of success

Validate transactions and secure the network

Proof of Work (PoW)
A consensus method requiring solving hard puzzles

Verifies transactions

Adds security and trust to the blockchain
